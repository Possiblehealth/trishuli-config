#### Configurations
All the configuration are put on the config repositories, and any thing else must be there in the Database.
#### Backup strategy and configuration
Backups are taken right now using a scheduled job triggered by the go-agent running in prod master. This backup is later copied to a folder in pre-prod which is synced to Dropbox. This will change with next deployment, as we are going to go with blue-green style of deployment, the DB backup should move to the shared storage or slave box. You can access the go-server at http://xx.x.x.30:8153
#### Monitoring setup
We use nagios to monitor the production boxes, nagios is installed in pre-prod box, which monitors the master and slave, and can be accessed at https://xx.x.x.30/nagios
